			<p>Hello!! this is the “about me “ part of my website. My name is Jack. I have kinda been programming on and off for several years, and recently decided I wanted to actually make a website of my own. (though a simple one, as I fell into vibe-coding for awhile...) anyway, I have many interests like computers, music production (that is also something I haven't done much with, I’ve never made any full songs... hopefully I will in the future? for now I’m going to focus on re-learning programming). some other interests are VR, (I have an Oculus Quest 2), annnnd well…. I can’t really think of much else right now…. I guess I’ll update this in the future. Anyway, I love listening to music. One of my favorite artists is Jogging House, who makes really nice, calming music. I have their Spotify embedded below. I Promise I will add more artists in the future, but this is all I will do for now. Thank you for reading!</p>
